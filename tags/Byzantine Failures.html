We assume the full information model where the Byzantine nodes have complete knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes), have unbounded computational power and can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol.  The churn is  controlled by an adversary that has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and also may rewire the topology in every round and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm. Byzantine protocols for fundamental distributed computing problems such as agreement and leader election have been studied extensively for the last three decades in static networks; however, these solutions do not work in dynamic networks which characterize many real-world networks such as P2P networks. Our main contribution is an $O(\log^3 n)$ round algorithm that achieves Byzantine leader election  under the presence of up to $O({n}^{1/2 - \epsilon})$ Byzantine nodes (for a small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$) and a churn of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{poly}\log(n))$ nodes per round (where $n$ is the stable network size).  The algorithm elects a leader with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ and guarantees that it is an honest node with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$; assuming the algorithm succeeds, the leader&#39;s identity will be known to a $1-o(1)$ fraction of the honest nodes. Our algorithm is fully-distributed, localized (does not require any global knowledge), lightweight, and is simple to implement. It is also scalable, as it runs in polylogarithmic time and requires nodes to send and receive messages of only polylogarithmic size per round.  To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first scalable solution for Byzantine leader election in a  dynamic network with a high rate of churn; our protocol can also be used to solve Byzantine agreement in a straightforward way.  We also show how to implement an (almost-everywhere) public coin with constant bias in a dynamic network with Byzantine nodes and provide a mechanism for enabling honest nodes to store information reliably in the network, which might be of independent interest.  In decentralized and dynamic P2P systems where a substantial part of the network may be controlled by malicious nodes, the presented algorithm and techniques  can serve as building blocks for designing robust and secure distributed protocols.</div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2013</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Fast Byzantine Agreement in Dynamic Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/grsjk7uwxilm2wz/PODC2013-1.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2484239.2484274" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson <span class="publicationInfo">32nd ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">PODC 2013</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We study Byzantine agreement in dynamic networks where topology  can change from round to round and nodes can also experience heavy  churn (i.e., nodes can join and leave the network continuously over time).  Our main contributions are  randomized  distributed algorithms that guarantee   almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability even under a large number of Byzantine nodes and continuous adversarial churn in a number of rounds that is polylogarithmic in $n$ (where $n$ is the stable network size). We show that our algorithms are essentially optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors)  with respect to the amount of Byzantine nodes and churn rate that they can tolerate by showing lower bound. In particular, we present the following results: \begin{enumerate} \item An $O(\log^3 n)$ round   randomized algorithm that achieves almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability under a presence of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ Byzantine nodes and up to a churn of $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ nodes per round. We assume that the Byzantine nodes have knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes) and can behave arbitrarily. We also assume that an  adversary controls the  churn --- it has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and has unlimited computational power (but is oblivious to the topology changes from round to round).  Our algorithm requires only polylogarithmic  in $n$  bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We also present an $O(\log^3 n)$ round randomized algorithm that has same guarantees as the above algorithm, but works even when the churn and network topology is controlled by an adaptive adversary (that can choose the topology based on the current states of the nodes). However, this algorithm requires up to polynomial in $n$ bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We show that the above bounds  are essentially the best possible, if one wants fast (i.e., polylogarithmic run time)  algorithms, by showing that  any (randomized) algorithm to achieve   agreement in a dynamic network controlled by an adversary  that can churn up to $\Theta(\sqrt{ n \log n})$ nodes per round should take at least a  polynomial number of rounds.  \end{enumerate} Our algorithms are the first-known, fully-distributed, Byzantine agreement algorithms in highly dynamic networks.  We view our results as a step towards understanding the possibilities and limitations of highly dynamic networks that are subject to malicious behavior by a large number of nodes.</div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2011</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Weak System Models for Fault-Tolerant Distributed Agreement Problems</span><br>Peter Robinson. <span class="publicationInfo">PhD Thesis in Computer Science.</span><br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This thesis investigates various aspects of weak system models for agreement problems in fault-tolerant distributed computing.  In Part~I we provide an introduction to the context of this work, discuss related literature and describe the basic system assumptions. In Part~II of this thesis, we introduce the Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle (ABC) model, which is entirely time-free.  In contrast to existing system models, the ABC model does not require explicit time-based synchrony bounds, but rather stipulates a graph-theoretic synchrony condition on the relative lengths of certain causal chains of messages in the space-time graph of a run.  We compare the ABC model to other models in literature, in particular to the classic models by Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer.  Despite Byzantine failures, we show how to simulate lock-step rounds, and therefore make consensus solvable, and prove the correctness of a clock synchronization algorithm in the ABC model.  We then present the technically most involved result of this thesis: We prove that any algorithm working correctly in the partially synchronous $\Theta$-Model by Le Lann and Schmid, also works correctly in the time-free ABC model.  In the proof, we use a variant of Farkas&#39; Theorem of Linear Inequalities and develop a non-standard cycle space on directed graphs in order to guarantee the existence of a certain message delay transformation for finite prefixes of runs.  This shows that any time-free safety property satisfied by an algorithm in the $\Theta$-Model also holds in the ABC model.  By employing methods from point-set topology, we can extend this result to liveness properties. In Part~III, we shift our attention to the borderland between models where consensus is solvable and the purely asynchronous model.  To this end, we look at the $k$-set agreement problem where processes need to decide on at most $k$ distinct decision values.  We introduce two very weak system models MAnti and MSink and prove that consensus is impossible in these models.  Nevertheless, we show that $(n-1)$-set agreement is solvable in MAnti and MSink, by providing algorithms that implement the weakest failure detector $\mathcal{L}$.  We also discuss how models MAnti and MSink relate to the $f$-source models by Aguilera et al. for solving consensus. In the subsequent chapter, we present a novel failure detector $\mathcal{L}(k)$ that generalizes $\mathcal{L}$, and analyze an algorithm for solving $k$-set agreement with $\mathcal{L}(k)$, which works even in systems without unique process identifiers.  Moreover, We explore  the relationship between $\mathcal{L}(k)$ and existing failure detectors for $k$-set agreement.  Some aspects of $\mathcal{L}(k)$ relating to anonymous systems  are also discussed. Next, we present a generic theorem that can be used to characterize the impossibility of achieving $k$-set agreement in various system models.  This enables us to show that $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)$ is not sufficient for solving $k$-set agreement.  Furthermore, we instantiate our theorem with a partially synchronous system model. Finally, we consider the $k$-set agreement problem in round-based systems.  First, we introduce a novel abstraction that encapsulates the perpetual synchrony of a run, the so called stable skeleton graph, which allows us to express the solvability power of a system via graph-theoretic properties.  We then present an approximation algorithm where processes output an estimate of their respective component of the stable skeleton graph.  We define a class of communication predicates PSources(k) in this framework, and show that PSources(k) tightly captures the amount of synchrony necessary for $k$-set agreement, as $(k-1)$-set agreement is impossible with PSources(k).  Based on the stable skeleton approximation, we present an algorithm that solves $k$-set agreement when PSources(k) holds.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">The Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle Model</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/56tr3r6dgq7e4i2/TCS2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2010.08.001" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Peter Robinson and Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 412 (2011) 5580–5601.</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This paper shows how synchrony conditions can be added to the purely asynchronous model in a way that avoids any reference to message delays and computing step times, as well as any global constraints on communication patterns and network topology.
