Motivated by a result of Ben-Or and Bar-Joseph (1998), showing that any consensus algorithm that is resilient against a linear number of crash faults requires $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ rounds in an $n$-node network against an adaptive adversary, we consider a late adaptive adversary, who has full knowledge of the network state at the beginning of the previous round and unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the current state of the nodes.  Our main contributions are randomized distributed algorithms that achieve consensus with high probability among all except a small constant fraction of the nodes (i.e., ``almost-everywhere&#39;&#39;) against a late adaptive adversary who can block up to $\epsilon n$ nodes in each round, for a small constant $\epsilon &gt;0$.  Our first protocol achieves binary almost-everywhere consensus and also guarantees a decision on the majority input value, thus ensuring plurality consensus.  We also present an algorithm that achieves the same time complexity for multi-value consensus.  Both of our algorithms succeed in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability, thus breaking the known $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for fully adaptive  adversaries.  Our algorithms are scalable to large systems as each node contacts only an (amortized) constant number of peers in each communication round.  We show that our algorithms are optimal up to constant (resp. sub-logarithmic) factors by proving that every almost-everywhere consensus protocol takes $\Omega(\log_d n)$ rounds in the worst case, where $d$ is an upper bound on the number of communication requests initiated per node in each round.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Gracefully Degrading Consensus and k-Set Agreement in Directed Dynamic Networks</span><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid, Manfred Schwarz, Kyrill Winkler. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 726: 41-77 (2018)</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2016</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">DEX: Self-Healing Expanders</span><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00446-015-0258-3" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson, Amitabh Trehan. <span class="publicationInfo">Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">DC</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We present a fully-distributed self-healing algorithm DEX, that  maintains a  constant degree expander network  in a dynamic setting.

MAnti[n-k] and MSink[n-k] are hence the first message passing models that lie between models where $\Omega$ (and therefore consensus) can be implemented and the purely asynchronous model.  We also address $k$-set agreement in anonymous systems, that is, in systems where (unique) process identifiers are not available. Since our novel $k$-set agreement algorithm using $\mathcal{L}(k)$ also works in anonymous systems, it turns out that the loneliness failure detector $\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}(n-1)$ introduced by Delporte et al. is also the weakest failure detector for set agreement in anonymous systems. Finally, we analyze the relationship between $\mathcal{L}(k)$ and other failure detectors suitable for solving $k$-set agreement.</div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2013</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Fast Byzantine Agreement in Dynamic Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/grsjk7uwxilm2wz/PODC2013-1.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2484239.2484274" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson <span class="publicationInfo">32nd ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">PODC 2013</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We study Byzantine agreement in dynamic networks where topology  can change from round to round and nodes can also experience heavy  churn (i.e., nodes can join and leave the network continuously over time).

These algorithms can serve as building blocks for implementing other non-trivial distributed computing tasks in dynamic P2P networks.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Agreement in Directed Dynamic Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0rx40khhv6qax81/SIROCCO2012.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31104-8_7" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">19th International Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">SIROCCO 2012</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We study distributed computation in synchronous dynamic networks where an omniscient adversary controls the unidirectional communication links.

We prove that consensus is impossible under some natural weak connectivity assumptions and introduce vertex-stable root components as a means for circumventing this impossibility.  Essentially, we assume that there is a short period of time during which an arbitrary part of the network remains strongly connected, while its interconnect topology may keep changing continuously.  We present a consensus algorithm that works under this assumption and prove its correctness. Our algorithm maintains a local estimate of the communication graphs and applies techniques for detecting stable network properties and univalent system configurations.  Our possibility results are complemented by several impossibility results and lower bounds for consensus and other distributed computing problems like leader election, revealing that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal.</div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2011</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Weak System Models for Fault-Tolerant Distributed Agreement Problems</span><br>Peter Robinson. <span class="publicationInfo">PhD Thesis in Computer Science.</span><br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This thesis investigates various aspects of weak system models for agreement problems in fault-tolerant distributed computing.  In Part~I we provide an introduction to the context of this work, discuss related literature and describe the basic system assumptions. In Part~II of this thesis, we introduce the Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle (ABC) model, which is entirely time-free.  In contrast to existing system models, the ABC model does not require explicit time-based synchrony bounds, but rather stipulates a graph-theoretic synchrony condition on the relative lengths of certain causal chains of messages in the space-time graph of a run.  We compare the ABC model to other models in literature, in particular to the classic models by Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer.  Despite Byzantine failures, we show how to simulate lock-step rounds, and therefore make consensus solvable, and prove the correctness of a clock synchronization algorithm in the ABC model.  We then present the technically most involved result of this thesis: We prove that any algorithm working correctly in the partially synchronous $\Theta$-Model by Le Lann and Schmid, also works correctly in the time-free ABC model.  In the proof, we use a variant of Farkas&#39; Theorem of Linear Inequalities and develop a non-standard cycle space on directed graphs in order to guarantee the existence of a certain message delay transformation for finite prefixes of runs.  This shows that any time-free safety property satisfied by an algorithm in the $\Theta$-Model also holds in the ABC model.  By employing methods from point-set topology, we can extend this result to liveness properties. In Part~III, we shift our attention to the borderland between models where consensus is solvable and the purely asynchronous model.  To this end, we look at the $k$-set agreement problem where processes need to decide on at most $k$ distinct decision values.  We introduce two very weak system models MAnti and MSink and prove that consensus is impossible in these models.  Nevertheless, we show that $(n-1)$-set agreement is solvable in MAnti and MSink, by providing algorithms that implement the weakest failure detector $\mathcal{L}$.  We also discuss how models MAnti and MSink relate to the $f$-source models by Aguilera et al. for solving consensus. In the subsequent chapter, we present a novel failure detector $\mathcal{L}(k)$ that generalizes $\mathcal{L}$, and analyze an algorithm for solving $k$-set agreement with $\mathcal{L}(k)$, which works even in systems without unique process identifiers.  Moreover, We explore  the relationship between $\mathcal{L}(k)$ and existing failure detectors for $k$-set agreement.  Some aspects of $\mathcal{L}(k)$ relating to anonymous systems  are also discussed. Next, we present a generic theorem that can be used to characterize the impossibility of achieving $k$-set agreement in various system models.  This enables us to show that $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)$ is not sufficient for solving $k$-set agreement.  Furthermore, we instantiate our theorem with a partially synchronous system model. Finally, we consider the $k$-set agreement problem in round-based systems.  First, we introduce a novel abstraction that encapsulates the perpetual synchrony of a run, the so called stable skeleton graph, which allows us to express the solvability power of a system via graph-theoretic properties.  We then present an approximation algorithm where processes output an estimate of their respective component of the stable skeleton graph.  We define a class of communication predicates PSources(k) in this framework, and show that PSources(k) tightly captures the amount of synchrony necessary for $k$-set agreement, as $(k-1)$-set agreement is impossible with PSources(k).  Based on the stable skeleton approximation, we present an algorithm that solves $k$-set agreement when PSources(k) holds.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Optimal Regional Consecutive Leader Election in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/tgv0lew3u6k2xdy/FOMC2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dl.acm.org/authorize?431055" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Hyun Chul Chung, Peter Robinson, Jennifer L.

We then present a fault-tolerant distributed algorithm that solves the RCLE problem and works even in settings where nodes do not have access to synchronized clocks.  Since nodes set their leader variable within $O(Dn)$ rounds, our algorithm is asymptotically optimal with respect to time complexity.  Due to its low message bit complexity, we believe that our algorithm is of practical interest for mobile wireless ad-hoc networks.

In this paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of $k$-set agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem resulting from a partitioning argument. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our result by exploring the possibility/impossibility border of $k$-set agreement in several message passing system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and, most importantly, (iii) asynchronous systems augmented with failure detectors.  Furthermore, by extending the algorithm for initial crashes of Fisher, Lynch and Patterson (1985) to general $k$-set agreement, we show that the impossibility border of (i) is tightly matched. The impossibility proofs in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are instantiations of our main theorem. Regarding (iii), applying our technique reveals the exact border for the parameter $k$ where $k$-set agreement is solvable with the failure detector class $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)_{1\le k\le n-1}$ of Bonnet and Raynal.  As $\Sigma_k$ was shown to be necessary for solving $k$-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the quest for the weakest failure detector</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">The Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle Model</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/56tr3r6dgq7e4i2/TCS2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2010.08.001" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Peter Robinson and Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 412 (2011) 5580–5601.</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This paper shows how synchrony conditions can be added to the purely asynchronous model in a way that avoids any reference to message delays and computing step times, as well as any global constraints on communication patterns and network topology.
