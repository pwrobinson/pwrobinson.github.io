In this paper, we study the cost of information dissemination in networks where edges have latencies, i.e., sending a message from one node to another takes some amount of time.  We first generalize the idea of conductance to weighted graphs, defining $\phi_*$ to be the ``weighted conductance&#39;&#39; and $\ell_*$ to be the ``critical latency.&#39;&#39;  One goal of this paper is to argue that $\phi_*$ characterizes the connectivity of a weighted graph with latencies in much the same way that conductance characterizes the connectivity of unweighted graphs.  We give near tight upper and lower bounds on the problem of information dissemination, up to polylogarithmic factors.  Specifically, we show that in a graph with (weighted) diameter $D$ (with latencies as weights), maximum degree $\Delta$, weighted conductance $\phi_*$ and critical latency $\ell_*$, any information dissemination algorithm requires at least $\Omega(\min(D+\Delta, \ell_*/\phi_*))$ time. We show several variants of the lower bound (e.g., for graphs with small diameter, graphs with small max-degree, etc.) by reduction to a simple combinatorial game.  We then give nearly matching algorithms, showing that information dissemination can be solved in $O(\min((D + \Delta)\log^3{n}), (\ell_*/\phi_*)\log(n))$ time.  % $O(\min(D\log^3(n), \ell_*\log(n)/\phi_*))$.  The algorithm consists of two sub-algorithms: This is achieved by combining two cases.  When nodes do not know the latency of the adjacent edges, we show that the classical push-pull algorithm is (near) optimal when the diameter or maximum degree is large.  For the case where the diameter and maximum degree are small, we give an alternative strategy in which we first discover the latencies and then use an algorithm for known latencies based on a weighted spanner construction.  (Our algorithms are within polylogarithmic factors of being tight both for known and unknown latencies.) </div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2014</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">The Generalized Loneliness Detector and Weak System Models for k-Set Agreement</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1t7l5tsyu4g9ktu/TPDS2014.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.77" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, vol. 25(4), 1078-1088</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">IEEE TPDS</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This paper presents two weak partially synchronous system models MAnti[n-k] and MSink[n-k], which are just strong enough for solving $k$-set agreement: We introduce the generalized $(n-k)$-loneliness failure detector $\mathcal{L}(k)$, which we first prove to be sufficient for solving $k$-set agreement, and show that $\mathcal{L}(k)$ but not $\mathcal{L}(k-1)$ can be implemented in both models.

In Part~I we provide an introduction to the context of this work, discuss related literature and describe the basic system assumptions. In Part~II of this thesis, we introduce the Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle (ABC) model, which is entirely time-free.  In contrast to existing system models, the ABC model does not require explicit time-based synchrony bounds, but rather stipulates a graph-theoretic synchrony condition on the relative lengths of certain causal chains of messages in the space-time graph of a run.  We compare the ABC model to other models in literature, in particular to the classic models by Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer.  Despite Byzantine failures, we show how to simulate lock-step rounds, and therefore make consensus solvable, and prove the correctness of a clock synchronization algorithm in the ABC model.  We then present the technically most involved result of this thesis: We prove that any algorithm working correctly in the partially synchronous $\Theta$-Model by Le Lann and Schmid, also works correctly in the time-free ABC model.  In the proof, we use a variant of Farkas&#39; Theorem of Linear Inequalities and develop a non-standard cycle space on directed graphs in order to guarantee the existence of a certain message delay transformation for finite prefixes of runs.  This shows that any time-free safety property satisfied by an algorithm in the $\Theta$-Model also holds in the ABC model.  By employing methods from point-set topology, we can extend this result to liveness properties. In Part~III, we shift our attention to the borderland between models where consensus is solvable and the purely asynchronous model.  To this end, we look at the $k$-set agreement problem where processes need to decide on at most $k$ distinct decision values.  We introduce two very weak system models MAnti and MSink and prove that consensus is impossible in these models.  Nevertheless, we show that $(n-1)$-set agreement is solvable in MAnti and MSink, by providing algorithms that implement the weakest failure detector $\mathcal{L}$.  We also discuss how models MAnti and MSink relate to the $f$-source models by Aguilera et al. for solving consensus. In the subsequent chapter, we present a novel failure detector $\mathcal{L}(k)$ that generalizes $\mathcal{L}$, and analyze an algorithm for solving $k$-set agreement with $\mathcal{L}(k)$, which works even in systems without unique process identifiers.  Moreover, We explore  the relationship between $\mathcal{L}(k)$ and existing failure detectors for $k$-set agreement.  Some aspects of $\mathcal{L}(k)$ relating to anonymous systems  are also discussed. Next, we present a generic theorem that can be used to characterize the impossibility of achieving $k$-set agreement in various system models.  This enables us to show that $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)$ is not sufficient for solving $k$-set agreement.  Furthermore, we instantiate our theorem with a partially synchronous system model. Finally, we consider the $k$-set agreement problem in round-based systems.  First, we introduce a novel abstraction that encapsulates the perpetual synchrony of a run, the so called stable skeleton graph, which allows us to express the solvability power of a system via graph-theoretic properties.  We then present an approximation algorithm where processes output an estimate of their respective component of the stable skeleton graph.  We define a class of communication predicates PSources(k) in this framework, and show that PSources(k) tightly captures the amount of synchrony necessary for $k$-set agreement, as $(k-1)$-set agreement is impossible with PSources(k).  Based on the stable skeleton approximation, we present an algorithm that solves $k$-set agreement when PSources(k) holds.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Easy Impossibility Proofs for k-Set Agreement in Message Passing Systems</span><a href="OPODIS 201://www.dropbox.com/s/ohur8g25xz858z3/OPODIS2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-25873-2_21" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">15th International Conference On Principles Of Distributed Systems</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">OPODIS 2011</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">Despite of being quite similar agreement problems, distributed consensus ($1$-set agreement) and general $k$-set agreement require surprisingly different techniques for proving their impossibility in asynchronous systems with crash failures: Rather, than the relatively simple bivalence arguments as in the impossibility proof for consensus in the presence of a single crash failure, known proofs for the impossibility of $k$-set agreement in shared memory systems with $f\geq k&gt;1$ crash failures use algebraic topology or a variant of Sperner&#39;s Lemma. In this paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of $k$-set agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem resulting from a partitioning argument. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our result by exploring the possibility/impossibility border of $k$-set agreement in several message passing system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and, most importantly, (iii) asynchronous systems augmented with failure detectors.  Furthermore, by extending the algorithm for initial crashes of Fisher, Lynch and Patterson (1985) to general $k$-set agreement, we show that the impossibility border of (i) is tightly matched. The impossibility proofs in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are instantiations of our main theorem. Regarding (iii), applying our technique reveals the exact border for the parameter $k$ where $k$-set agreement is solvable with the failure detector class $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)_{1\le k\le n-1}$ of Bonnet and Raynal.  As $\Sigma_k$ was shown to be necessary for solving $k$-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the quest for the weakest failure detector</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">The Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle Model</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/56tr3r6dgq7e4i2/TCS2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2010.08.001" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Peter Robinson and Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 412 (2011) 5580–5601.</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This paper shows how synchrony conditions can be added to the purely asynchronous model in a way that avoids any reference to message delays and computing step times, as well as any global constraints on communication patterns and network topology.
