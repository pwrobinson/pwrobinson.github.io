Motivated by a result of Ben-Or and Bar-Joseph (1998), showing that any consensus algorithm that is resilient against a linear number of crash faults requires $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{n})$ rounds in an $n$-node network against an adaptive adversary, we consider a late adaptive adversary, who has full knowledge of the network state at the beginning of the previous round and unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the current state of the nodes.  Our main contributions are randomized distributed algorithms that achieve consensus with high probability among all except a small constant fraction of the nodes (i.e., ``almost-everywhere&#39;&#39;) against a late adaptive adversary who can block up to $\epsilon n$ nodes in each round, for a small constant $\epsilon &gt;0$.  Our first protocol achieves binary almost-everywhere consensus and also guarantees a decision on the majority input value, thus ensuring plurality consensus.  We also present an algorithm that achieves the same time complexity for multi-value consensus.  Both of our algorithms succeed in $O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability, thus breaking the known $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for fully adaptive  adversaries.  Our algorithms are scalable to large systems as each node contacts only an (amortized) constant number of peers in each communication round.  We show that our algorithms are optimal up to constant (resp. sub-logarithmic) factors by proving that every almost-everywhere consensus protocol takes $\Omega(\log_d n)$ rounds in the worst case, where $d$ is an upper bound on the number of communication requests initiated per node in each round.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Gracefully Degrading Consensus and k-Set Agreement in Directed Dynamic Networks</span><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid, Manfred Schwarz, Kyrill Winkler. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 726: 41-77 (2018)</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2015</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Fast Byzantine Leader Election in Dynamic Networks</span><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson. <span class="publicationInfo">29th International Symposium on Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">DISC 2015</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract"> Motivated by robust, secure, and efficient distributed computation in  Peer-to-Peer (P2P)  networks, we study fundamental Byzantine problems in dynamic networks where the topology  can change from round to round and nodes can also experience heavy churn (i.e., nodes can join and leave the network continuously over time).  We assume the full information model where the Byzantine nodes have complete knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes), have unbounded computational power and can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol.  The churn is  controlled by an adversary that has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and also may rewire the topology in every round and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm. Byzantine protocols for fundamental distributed computing problems such as agreement and leader election have been studied extensively for the last three decades in static networks; however, these solutions do not work in dynamic networks which characterize many real-world networks such as P2P networks. Our main contribution is an $O(\log^3 n)$ round algorithm that achieves Byzantine leader election  under the presence of up to $O({n}^{1/2 - \epsilon})$ Byzantine nodes (for a small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$) and a churn of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{poly}\log(n))$ nodes per round (where $n$ is the stable network size).  The algorithm elects a leader with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ and guarantees that it is an honest node with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$; assuming the algorithm succeeds, the leader&#39;s identity will be known to a $1-o(1)$ fraction of the honest nodes. Our algorithm is fully-distributed, localized (does not require any global knowledge), lightweight, and is simple to implement. It is also scalable, as it runs in polylogarithmic time and requires nodes to send and receive messages of only polylogarithmic size per round.  To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first scalable solution for Byzantine leader election in a  dynamic network with a high rate of churn; our protocol can also be used to solve Byzantine agreement in a straightforward way.  We also show how to implement an (almost-everywhere) public coin with constant bias in a dynamic network with Byzantine nodes and provide a mechanism for enabling honest nodes to store information reliably in the network, which might be of independent interest.  In decentralized and dynamic P2P systems where a substantial part of the network may be controlled by malicious nodes, the presented algorithm and techniques  can serve as building blocks for designing robust and secure distributed protocols.</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Gracefully Degrading Consensus and k-Set Agreement in Directed Dynamic Networks</span><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-26850-7_8" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Martin Biely, Peter Robinson, Ulrich Schmid, Manfred Schwarz, Kyrill Winkler. <span class="publicationInfo">2nd International Conference on Networked Systems</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">NETYS 2015</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We present the first consensus/k-set agreement algorithm for synchronous dynamic networks with unidirectional links, controlled by an omniscient message adversary, which automatically adapts to the actual network properties in a run: If the network is sufficiently well-connected, it solves consensus, while it degrades gracefully to general k-set agreement in less well-connected communication graphs.

In this paper, we present a generic theorem for proving the impossibility of $k$-set agreement in various message passing settings, which is based on a reduction to the consensus impossibility in a certain subsystem resulting from a partitioning argument. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our result by exploring the possibility/impossibility border of $k$-set agreement in several message passing system models: (i) asynchronous systems with crash failures, (ii) partially synchronous processes with (initial) crash failures, and, most importantly, (iii) asynchronous systems augmented with failure detectors.  Furthermore, by extending the algorithm for initial crashes of Fisher, Lynch and Patterson (1985) to general $k$-set agreement, we show that the impossibility border of (i) is tightly matched. The impossibility proofs in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) are instantiations of our main theorem. Regarding (iii), applying our technique reveals the exact border for the parameter $k$ where $k$-set agreement is solvable with the failure detector class $(\Sigma_k,\Omega_k)_{1\le k\le n-1}$ of Bonnet and Raynal.  As $\Sigma_k$ was shown to be necessary for solving $k$-set agreement, this result yields new insights on the quest for the weakest failure detector</div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">The Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle Model</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/56tr3r6dgq7e4i2/TCS2011.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2010.08.001" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>Peter Robinson and Ulrich Schmid. <span class="publicationInfo">Theoretical Computer Science 412 (2011) 5580–5601.</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">TCS</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">This paper shows how synchrony conditions can be added to the purely asynchronous model in a way that avoids any reference to message delays and computing step times, as well as any global constraints on communication patterns and network topology. Our Asynchronous Bounded-Cycle (ABC) model just bounds the ratio of the number of forward- and backward-oriented messages in certain &#39;&#39;relevant&#39;&#39; cycles in the space-time diagram of an asynchronous execution.  We show that clock synchronization and lock-step rounds can easily be implemented and proved correct in the ABC model, even in the presence of Byzantine failures.  Furthermore, we prove that any algorithm working correctly in the partially synchronous $\Theta$-Model also works correctly in the ABC model. In our proof, we first apply a novel method for assigning certain message delays to asynchronous executions, which is based on a variant of Farkas&#39; theorem of linear inequalities and a non-standard cycle-space of graphs. Using methods from point-set topology, we then prove that the existence of this delay assignment implies model indistinguishability for time-free safety and liveness properties.  Finally, we introduce several weaker variants of the ABC model and relate our model to the existing partially synchronous system models, in particular, the classic models of Dwork, Lynch and Stockmayer. Furthermore, we discuss aspects of the ABC model&#39;s applicability in real systems, in particular, in the context of VLSI Systems-on-Chip.</div></li></ul></div></div><div class="intro revealOnScroll"><h2><a class="anchor" id="Code">Code</a></h2><div>I&#39;m interested in parallel and distributed programming and related technologies such as software transactional memory and the actor-model.
