Our goal is to maintain a sparse (bounded degree) expander topology  despite heavy churn (i.e., nodes  joining and leaving the network continuously over time).  We assume that the churn is  controlled by an adversary that has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time   and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm. Our main contribution is a randomized distributed protocol that guarantees  with high probability the maintenance of a constant degree graph with high expansion even under continuous  high adversarial churn. Our protocol can tolerate  a churn rate of up to $O(n/\text{polylog}(n))$ per round (where $n$ is the stable network size).  Our protocol is efficient, lightweight, and scalable, and it  incurs only $O(\text{polylog}(n))$ overhead  for topology maintenance:  only  polylogarithmic  (in $n$)  bits needs to be processed and sent  by each node per round and any node&#39;s computation cost per round is also polylogarithmic. The given protocol is a  fundamental ingredient that is needed for the design of efficient fully-distributed algorithms for solving fundamental distributed computing problems such as agreement,  leader election, search, and storage in highly dynamic P2P networks and enables fast and scalable algorithms for these problems that can tolerate a large amount of churn. </div></li><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Fast Byzantine Leader Election in Dynamic Networks</span><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson. <span class="publicationInfo">29th International Symposium on Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">DISC 2015</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract"> Motivated by robust, secure, and efficient distributed computation in  Peer-to-Peer (P2P)  networks, we study fundamental Byzantine problems in dynamic networks where the topology  can change from round to round and nodes can also experience heavy churn (i.e., nodes can join and leave the network continuously over time).  We assume the full information model where the Byzantine nodes have complete knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes), have unbounded computational power and can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol.  The churn is  controlled by an adversary that has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and also may rewire the topology in every round and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm. Byzantine protocols for fundamental distributed computing problems such as agreement and leader election have been studied extensively for the last three decades in static networks; however, these solutions do not work in dynamic networks which characterize many real-world networks such as P2P networks. Our main contribution is an $O(\log^3 n)$ round algorithm that achieves Byzantine leader election  under the presence of up to $O({n}^{1/2 - \epsilon})$ Byzantine nodes (for a small constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$) and a churn of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{poly}\log(n))$ nodes per round (where $n$ is the stable network size).  The algorithm elects a leader with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ and guarantees that it is an honest node with probability at least $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$; assuming the algorithm succeeds, the leader&#39;s identity will be known to a $1-o(1)$ fraction of the honest nodes. Our algorithm is fully-distributed, localized (does not require any global knowledge), lightweight, and is simple to implement. It is also scalable, as it runs in polylogarithmic time and requires nodes to send and receive messages of only polylogarithmic size per round.  To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first scalable solution for Byzantine leader election in a  dynamic network with a high rate of churn; our protocol can also be used to solve Byzantine agreement in a straightforward way.  We also show how to implement an (almost-everywhere) public coin with constant bias in a dynamic network with Byzantine nodes and provide a mechanism for enabling honest nodes to store information reliably in the network, which might be of independent interest.  In decentralized and dynamic P2P systems where a substantial part of the network may be controlled by malicious nodes, the presented algorithm and techniques  can serve as building blocks for designing robust and secure distributed protocols.</div></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2014</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Distributed Agreement in Dynamic Peer-to-Peer Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dncy2vxs9kfc7h6/JCSS2015.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2014.10.005" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson, Eli Upfal. <span class="publicationInfo">Journal of Computer and System Sciences, Elsevier.</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">JCSS</span>). <br></li></ul></div><div class="yearContainer"><span class="year">2013</span><ul class="yearList fa-ul"><li class="entry"><i class="fa fa-li fa-caret-right"></i><span class="publicationTitle">Fast Byzantine Agreement in Dynamic Networks</span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/grsjk7uwxilm2wz/PODC2013-1.pdf?dl=0" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-lg">PDF</span></a><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2484239.2484274" target="_new" class="icon"><span class="fa fa-external-link fa-lg">DOI</span></a><br>John Augustine, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson <span class="publicationInfo">32nd ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing</span> (<span class="publicationConfShort">PODC 2013</span>). <br><a class="abstractToggle invisibleAbstract"><span class="fa fa-plus-square-o">Abstract</span></a><div class="abstract">We study Byzantine agreement in dynamic networks where topology  can change from round to round and nodes can also experience heavy  churn (i.e., nodes can join and leave the network continuously over time).  Our main contributions are  randomized  distributed algorithms that guarantee   almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability even under a large number of Byzantine nodes and continuous adversarial churn in a number of rounds that is polylogarithmic in $n$ (where $n$ is the stable network size). We show that our algorithms are essentially optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors)  with respect to the amount of Byzantine nodes and churn rate that they can tolerate by showing lower bound. In particular, we present the following results: \begin{enumerate} \item An $O(\log^3 n)$ round   randomized algorithm that achieves almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability under a presence of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ Byzantine nodes and up to a churn of $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ nodes per round. We assume that the Byzantine nodes have knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes) and can behave arbitrarily. We also assume that an  adversary controls the  churn --- it has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and has unlimited computational power (but is oblivious to the topology changes from round to round).  Our algorithm requires only polylogarithmic  in $n$  bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We also present an $O(\log^3 n)$ round randomized algorithm that has same guarantees as the above algorithm, but works even when the churn and network topology is controlled by an adaptive adversary (that can choose the topology based on the current states of the nodes). However, this algorithm requires up to polynomial in $n$ bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We show that the above bounds  are essentially the best possible, if one wants fast (i.e., polylogarithmic run time)  algorithms, by showing that  any (randomized) algorithm to achieve   agreement in a dynamic network controlled by an adversary  that can churn up to $\Theta(\sqrt{ n \log n})$ nodes per round should take at least a  polynomial number of rounds.  \end{enumerate} Our algorithms are the first-known, fully-distributed, Byzantine agreement algorithms in highly dynamic networks.  We view our results as a step towards understanding the possibilities and limitations of highly dynamic networks that are subject to malicious behavior by a large number of nodes.</div></li></ul></div></div><div class="intro revealOnScroll"><h2><a class="anchor" id="Code">Code</a></h2><div>I&#39;m interested in parallel and distributed programming and related technologies such as software transactional memory.
