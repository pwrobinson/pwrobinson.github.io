Our main contributions are  randomized  distributed algorithms that guarantee   almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability even under a large number of Byzantine nodes and continuous adversarial churn in a number of rounds that is polylogarithmic in $n$ (where $n$ is the stable network size). We show that our algorithms are essentially optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors)  with respect to the amount of Byzantine nodes and churn rate that they can tolerate by showing lower bound. In particular, we present the following results: \begin{enumerate} \item An $O(\log^3 n)$ round   randomized algorithm that achieves almost-everywhere Byzantine agreement with high probability under a presence of up to $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ Byzantine nodes and up to a churn of $O(\sqrt{n}/\text{polylog}(n))$ nodes per round. We assume that the Byzantine nodes have knowledge about the entire state of network at every round (including random choices made by all the nodes) and can behave arbitrarily. We also assume that an  adversary controls the  churn --- it has  complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and  at what time  and has unlimited computational power (but is oblivious to the topology changes from round to round).  Our algorithm requires only polylogarithmic  in $n$  bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We also present an $O(\log^3 n)$ round randomized algorithm that has same guarantees as the above algorithm, but works even when the churn and network topology is controlled by an adaptive adversary (that can choose the topology based on the current states of the nodes). However, this algorithm requires up to polynomial in $n$ bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.  \item We show that the above bounds  are essentially the best possible, if one wants fast (i.e., polylogarithmic run time)  algorithms, by showing that  any (randomized) algorithm to achieve   agreement in a dynamic network controlled by an adversary  that can churn up to $\Theta(\sqrt{ n \log n})$ nodes per round should take at least a  polynomial number of rounds.  \end{enumerate} Our algorithms are the first-known, fully-distributed, Byzantine agreement algorithms in highly dynamic networks.
